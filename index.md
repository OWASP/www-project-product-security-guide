<div style="color:blue; font-size:20px;"><b>Welcome to the OWASP Product Security Guide!</b></div>

This guide is structured into three core parts:
1. [<span style="color:green;">How products are being attacked?</span>](#how-products-are-being-attacked)
2. [<span style="color:green;">How to secure products?</span>](#how-to-secure-products)
3. [<span style="color:green;">Role of AI/LLM in product security</span>](#role-of-ai-llm-in-product-security)

Application security focuses on code-level vulnerabilities, while **<span style="color:orange;">product security</span>** addresses broader aspects like design flaws and supply chain risks. Rising concerns in **<span style="color:red;">privacy</span>** and **<span style="color:red;">security</span>** stem from AI/LLMs, posing threats like data breaches, biased algorithms, and manipulation of personal information. This guide provides insights on designing, creating, testing, and procuring secure, privacy-preserving products.

<div style="color:purple; font-size:18px;"><b>How products are being attacked?</b></div>

**<span style="color:blue;">SDLC</span>** and **[supply chain vulnerabilities](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks)** are exploited through various methods. In the **[SDLC](https://mediasmarts.ca/digital-media-literacy/digital-issues/cyber-security/cyber-security-software-threats)**, attackers exploit weaknesses in development, testing, or deployment phases by injecting malicious code or compromising tools and libraries.

- **Techniques**:
  - **<span style="color:green;">Code Injection</span>**: Inserting malicious commands into code.
  - **<span style="color:green;">Dependency Confusion</span>**: Substituting trusted dependencies with malicious ones.
  - **<span style="color:green;">Hijacking</span>**: Exploiting authentication or authorization weaknesses.

These underscore the **[critical need for robust security measures](https://jfrog.com/blog/the-importance-of-prioritizing-product-security/)** across the software lifecycle.


<div style="color:purple; font-size:18px;"><b>How to Secure Products?</b></div>

### **Part 1: Foundations of Secure Product Design**

#### <span style="color:green;">Threat Modeling</span>
During the early stages of development, identify potential risks to ensure secure product design.

- **<span style="color:blue;">Key Steps:</span>**
  - Identify assets, threats, and attack vectors.
  - Use tools like **STRIDE** and **PASTA** for threat analysis.
  - Integrate findings into the SDLC.


#### <span style="color:green;">Secure Architecture Principles</span>
Establish a robust architecture for secure product functionality.

- **Defense-in-depth**: Use layered controls like firewalls and encryption.
- **Secure communication**: Enforce HTTPS and encrypt data using **AES-256**.
- **Best practices**: Validate input and sanitize output to prevent injections.


#### <span style="color:green;">Secure Configuration Management</span>
Ensure consistent security configurations and proactive updates.

- **Hardened defaults**: Enforce strong configurations like MFA and password policies.
- **Patch management**: Monitor and update to address vulnerabilities.


### **Part 2: Securing the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

#### <span style="color:green;">Security in Requirements</span>
Identify and incorporate security considerations early.

- **Sample functional requirement**: Allow users to upload profile images.
- **Sample security consideration**: Validate file types to block malicious uploads.


#### <span style="color:green;">Secure Development Practices</span>
Adopt practices that minimize security risks during coding.

- **Best practices**:
  - Validate inputs and sanitize outputs.
  - Use tools like **OWASP Dependency-Check** for vulnerability detection.


#### <span style="color:green;">Security Testing and Verification</span>
Test products to ensure they meet security standards.

- **Tools and methods**:
  - **SAST**: Analyze static code for vulnerabilities.
  - **DAST**: Test running applications dynamically.
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Automate security checks in deployment pipelines.


#### <span style="color:green;">Secure Deployment and Operations</span>
Secure post-deployment practices to reduce operational risks.

- **Incident response**: Define clear procedures for breach management.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like SIEM for real-time security analysis.


### **Part 3: Advanced Topics**

#### <span style="color:green;">Security for Emerging Technologies</span>
Address challenges posed by modern tech, like AI and IoT.

- **AI Risks**:
  - **Bias**: Ensure diverse training datasets.
  - **Poisoning**: Monitor model inputs to prevent manipulation.
- **IoT Security**: Secure devices using strong authentication and encryption.
