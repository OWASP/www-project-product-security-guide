<div style="color:blue; font-size:20px;"><b>Welcome to the OWASP Product Security Guide!</b></div>

This page is the OWASP product security guide. It has three parts:  
1. [<span style="color:green;">How products are being attacked?</span>](#how-products-are-being-attacked?)  
2. [<span style="color:green;">How to secure products?</span>](#how-to-secure-products?)  
3. [<span style="color:green;">Role of AI/LLM in product security</span>](#role-of-AI/LLM-product-security)  

Application security focuses on code-level vulnerabilities, while **<span style="color:orange;">product security</span>** addresses broader aspects like design flaws and supply chain risks. Rising concerns in **<span style="color:red;">privacy</span>** and **<span style="color:red;">security</span>** stem from AI/LLMs, posing threats like data breaches, biased algorithms, and manipulation of personal information. This guide serves as a document offering insights on designing, creating, testing, and procuring secure and privacy-preserving products.

# <span style="color:purple;">How products are being attacked?</span>

**SDLC** and [supply chain vulnerabilities](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks) are exploited through various methods.  

In the [<span style="color:blue;">SDLC</span>](https://mediasmarts.ca/digital-media-literacy/digital-issues/cyber-security/cyber-security-software-threats), attackers leverage weaknesses in development, testing, or deployment phases, injecting malicious code or compromising tools and libraries. Supply chain attacks involve infiltrating trusted vendors or third-party components to distribute malware or tamper with updates, compromising downstream systems.

Techniques like **<span style="color:green;">code injection</span>**, **<span style="color:green;">dependency confusion</span>**, or **<span style="color:green;">hijacking</span>** exploit authentication, authorization, or distribution weaknesses, leading to breaches, data theft, or system compromise.  

These highlight the [critical need for robust security measures](https://jfrog.com/blog/the-importance-of-prioritizing-product-security/) across the software development and distribution lifecycle.

# <span style="color:purple;">How to secure products?</span>

## Part 1: Foundations of Secure Product Design

### <span style="color:green;">Threat Modeling</span>

During the early stages of development, identifying threats and vulnerabilities ensures the product is designed with security in mind.

- **Identifying assets, threats, and attack vectors**:
  - Assets: Determine what needs protection (e.g., sensitive data, APIs).
  - Threats: Identify potential adversaries (e.g., malicious insiders, hackers).
  - Attack Vectors: Understand how assets could be exploited (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

- **Tools and techniques**:
  - **STRIDE**: Focuses on Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
  - **PASTA**: A risk-centric framework combining business and technical perspectives to identify and prioritize threats.

- **Sample integration into SDLC**: Include threat modeling in design reviews, ensuring high-priority risks are addressed before development begins.

---

### <span style="color:green;">Secure Architecture Principles</span>

A secure product architecture forms the foundation for protecting the product throughout its lifecycle.

- **Defense-in-depth**: Layer security controls to mitigate risks from multiple angles (e.g., firewalls, encryption, authentication).
- **Principle of least privilege**: Ensure users and processes only have access essential for their functions.
- **Secure communication and encryption**:
  - Use TLS for secure data transmission.
  - Encrypt data at rest using strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
  - Store keys securely using key vaults.
- **Sample guideline**: Implement secure coding practices, such as validating input and sanitizing output, to prevent injection attacks.

---

### <span style="color:green;">Secure Configuration Management</span>

Effective configuration management ensures the product remains secure even as it evolves.

- **Hardened defaults**: Disable unnecessary features and enforce strong defaults (e.g., password complexity).
- **Minimizing configuration drift**: Use tools like Ansible or Terraform to maintain consistent environments.
- **Patch management**:
  - Regularly update software to address vulnerabilities.
  - Monitor CVEs and automate updates where possible.

---

## Part 2: Securing the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### <span style="color:green;">Security in Requirements</span>

Identifying security considerations during the requirements phase is critical for proactive risk mitigation.

- **Sample functional requirement**: Allow users to upload profile images.
- **Sample security consideration**: Validate file types and enforce size limits to prevent malicious uploads.

---

### <span style="color:green;">Secure Development Practices</span>

Implementing secure coding practices reduces vulnerabilities in the final product.

- **Writing secure code**:
  - Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and handle errors without exposing sensitive data.
- **Secure API design**: Use authentication (e.g., OAuth) and enforce role-based access controls.
- **Leveraging SAST and SCA**: Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

---

### <span style="color:green;">Security Testing and Verification</span>

Security testing ensures the product meets its design specifications and resists common attack vectors.

- **Automated testing**:
  - Use SAST tools like CodeQL for static code analysis.
  - Implement DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for dynamic testing.
- **Penetration testing**: Simulate real-world attacks to identify gaps missed by automated tools.
- **Sample CI/CD integration**: Automate security tests in the pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.

---

### <span style="color:green;">Secure Deployment and Operations</span>

Ensuring secure deployment and ongoing operations minimizes risks during production.

- **Configuration management**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to enforce consistent, secure environments.
- **Incident response planning**: Create clear procedures for identifying, analyzing, and resolving security incidents.
- **Post-deployment vulnerability management**: Monitor for zero-day vulnerabilities and release patches promptly.
