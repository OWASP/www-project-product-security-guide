Welcome to the **OWASP Product Security Guide**! This guide provides actionable insights into:
1. [How products are being attacked?](#how-products-are-being-attacked)
2. [How to secure products?](#how-to-secure-products)
3. [Role of AI/LLM in product security](#role-of-ai-llm-in-product-security)

Product security extends beyond application security by addressing design flaws, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the risks associated with AI/LLMs. This guide serves as a resource for developers, product owners, and organizations to build secure and privacy-preserving products.
