### **<span style="color:green;">Foreword: Why Product Security Matters</span>**
- **<span style="color:orange;">Relevance:</span>** Security is essential in todayâ€™s interconnected and AI-driven world.
- **<span style="color:orange;">Focus:</span>** Moves beyond application security to address broader risks like design flaws and supply chain vulnerabilities.
- **<span style="color:orange;">Emerging Tech:</span>** Includes guidance for AI, IoT, and cloud-native applications.

---

### **<span style="color:green;">Introduction</span>**
- **<span style="color:blue;">Purpose:</span>** Equip developers, security professionals, and product managers with actionable steps to ensure secure development.
- **<span style="color:blue;">Benefits:</span>** Reduce breaches, improve trust, and meet compliance requirements.
- **<span style="color:blue;">Audience:</span>** Developers, Security Professionals, Product Managers, and Architects.

### **<span style="color:green;">Part 1: Foundations of Secure Product Design</span>**

#### **<span style="color:orange;">1. Threat Modeling</span>**
- Identify assets, threats, and attack vectors using frameworks like **STRIDE** or **PASTA**.
- Prioritize risks and incorporate findings into the SDLC.

#### **<span style="color:orange;">2. Secure Architecture Principles</span>**
- Implement **Defense-in-Depth** and **Least Privilege** strategies.
- Use robust encryption and secure communication protocols (e.g., **TLS**, **AES-256**).

#### **<span style="color:orange;">3. Secure Configuration Management</span>**
- Use hardened defaults and tools like Ansible to enforce consistent configurations.
- Regularly patch software and monitor for vulnerabilities.

### **<span style="color:green;">Part 2: Securing the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</span>**

#### **<span style="color:orange;">1. Security in Requirements</span>**
- Integrate security requirements early in the development process.

#### **<span style="color:orange;">2. Secure Development</span>**
- Write secure code: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and manage dependencies using **SAST** and **SCA** tools.

#### **<span style="color:orange;">3. Testing and Verification</span>**
- Use automated testing tools like **OWASP ZAP** for **SAST** and **DAST**.
- Conduct penetration testing and manual reviews for additional assurance.

#### **<span style="color:orange;">4. Deployment and Operations</span>**
- Secure infrastructure and configurations.
- Plan for incident response and monitor for post-deployment vulnerabilities.

### **<span style="color:green;">Part 3: Advanced Topics</span>**

#### **<span style="color:orange;">1. Emerging Technologies</span>**
- Address risks in AI/LLMs (e.g., bias, poisoning attacks).
- Secure IoT devices and cloud-native applications.

#### **<span style="color:orange;">2. DevSecOps</span>**
- Shift left by integrating security early in development.
- Automate testing and foster security champions within teams.
