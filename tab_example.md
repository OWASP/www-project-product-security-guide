## <span style="color:green;">**Part 1: Foundations of Secure Product Design**</span>

### <span style="color:orange;">**1. Threat Modeling**</span>
- Identify assets, threats, and attack vectors using frameworks like <span style="color:blue;">**STRIDE**</span> or <span style="color:blue;">**PASTA**</span>.
- Prioritize risks and incorporate findings into the SDLC.

### <span style="color:orange;">**2. Secure Architecture Principles**</span>
- Implement <span style="color:blue;">**Defense-in-Depth**</span> and <span style="color:blue;">**Least Privilege**</span> strategies.
- Use robust encryption and secure communication protocols (e.g., <span style="color:blue;">**TLS**</span>, <span style="color:blue;">**AES-256**</span>).

### <span style="color:orange;">**3. Secure Configuration Management**</span>
- Use hardened defaults and tools like <span style="color:blue;">**Ansible**</span> to enforce consistent configurations.
- Regularly patch software and monitor for vulnerabilities.

## <span style="color:green;">**Part 2: Securing the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**</span>

### <span style="color:orange;">**1. Security in Requirements**</span>
- Integrate security requirements early in the development process.

### <span style="color:orange;">**2. Secure Development**</span>
- Write secure code: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and manage dependencies using <span style="color:blue;">**SAST**</span> and <span style="color:blue;">**SCA**</span> tools.

### <span style="color:orange;">**3. Testing and Verification**</span>
- Use automated testing tools like <span style="color:blue;">**OWASP ZAP**</span> for <span style="color:blue;">**SAST**</span> and <span style="color:blue;">**DAST**</span>.
- Conduct penetration testing and manual reviews for additional assurance.

### <span style="color:orange;">**4. Deployment and Operations**</span>
- Secure infrastructure and configurations.
- Plan for incident response and monitor for post-deployment vulnerabilities.

---

## <span style="color:green;">**Part 3: Advanced Topics**</span>

### <span style="color:orange;">**1. Emerging Technologies**</span>
- Address risks in AI/LLMs (e.g., bias, poisoning attacks).
- Secure IoT devices and cloud-native applications.

### <span style="color:orange;">**2. DevSecOps**</span>
- Shift left by integrating security early in development.
- Automate testing and foster security champions within teams.
