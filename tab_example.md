### <span style="color: #9b59b6;">**Part 1: Foundations of Secure Product Design**</span>

#### <span style="color: #2ecc71;">**1. Threat Modeling**</span>
- Identify assets, threats, and attack vectors using frameworks like **<span style="color: #d35400;">STRIDE</span>** or **<span style="color: #3498db;">PASTA</span>**.
- Prioritize risks and incorporate findings into the SDLC.

#### <span style="color: #e67e22;">**2. Secure Architecture Principles**</span>
- Implement **<span style="color: #c0392b;">Defense-in-Depth</span>** and **<span style="color: #2980b9;">Least Privilege</span>** strategies.
- Use robust encryption and secure communication protocols (e.g., **<span style="color: #27ae60;">TLS</span>**, **<span style="color: #8e44ad;">AES-256</span>**).

#### <span style="color: #f1c40f;">**3. Secure Configuration Management**</span>
- Use hardened defaults and tools like **<span style="color: #3498db;">Ansible</span>** to enforce consistent configurations.
- Regularly patch software and monitor for vulnerabilities.

### <span style="color: #16a085;">**Part 2: Securing the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**</span>

#### <span style="color: #3498db;">**1. Security in Requirements**</span>
- Integrate security requirements early in the development process.

#### <span style="color: #e74c3c;">**2. Secure Development**</span>
- Write secure code: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and manage dependencies using **<span style="color: #9b59b6;">SAST</span>** and **<span style="color: #d35400;">SCA</span>** tools.

#### <span style="color: #f39c12;">**3. Testing and Verification**</span>
- Use automated testing tools like **<span style="color: #27ae60;">OWASP ZAP</span>** for **<span style="color: #2980b9;">SAST</span>** and **<span style="color: #c0392b;">DAST</span>**.
- Conduct penetration testing and manual reviews for additional assurance.

#### <span style="color: #8e44ad;">**4. Deployment and Operations**</span>
- Secure infrastructure and configurations.
- Plan for incident response and monitor for post-deployment vulnerabilities.

### <span style="color: #e74c3c;">**Part 3: Advanced Topics**</span>

#### <span style="color: #16a085;">**1. Emerging Technologies**</span>
- Address risks in **<span style="color: #2980b9;">AI/LLMs</span>** (e.g., bias, poisoning attacks).
- Secure **<span style="color: #e67e22;">IoT devices</span>** and **<span style="color: #27ae60;">cloud-native applications</span>**.

#### <span style="color: #9b59b6;">**2. DevSecOps**</span>
- Shift left by integrating security early in development.
- Automate testing and foster security champions within teams.
